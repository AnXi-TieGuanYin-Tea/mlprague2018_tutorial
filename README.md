# Abstract

Deep Learning has re-entered the field of Machine Learning with a big bang. Tasks that were difficult and cumbersome to solve are now simple to implement and achieve amazingly high accuracies. Deep Learning has shown substantial impact recently also in the domain of audio recognition and music classification. This tutorial will give a general introduction to Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, plus important concepts such as (batch-)normalization, training epochs, activation, loss, optimization, pooling, dropout, model fine-tuning, etc. and a tutorial on how to apply all of this on tasks of audio and music recognition using the convenient Python Keras framework on top of Tensorflow. It will use T-SNE for visualization and also cover unsupervised learning.
